# Data Science Assessment Repository

Welcome to the **Data Science Assessment Repository** of \[Your Organization Name]. This repository contains a collection of code files, datasets, and resources used for various data science assessments. The files included in this repository are aimed at providing solutions to real-world problems using a variety of data science techniques, including regression, classification, and clustering.

---

## **Repository Structure**

This repository is divided into two main categories of files:

### 1. **Assessment Files**

These files contain important data sets and evaluation files that have been used to assess data science models and solutions in our organization. They represent real-world business problems and are part of our internal assessment process.

* **ToyotaCorolla - MLR.csv**: A dataset containing various features of Toyota Corolla cars, used for the assessment of multiple linear regression (MLR) models.
* \[Other files you might have]

### 2. **Data Science Code Files**

These are Python code files that implement various machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and evaluation strategies. These files serve as solutions or experiments for data science tasks.

#### **Algorithms Implemented:**

* **Linear Regression (linear\_regression.py)**: Implements a basic linear regression model to predict continuous values.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (knn.py)**: Implements the KNN algorithm for classification tasks, used for categorizing data points into distinct groups.
* **Decision Trees (decision\_tree.py)**: Implements a decision tree for classification and regression tasks.
* **Random Forest (random\_forest.py)**: Implements a random forest model for classification and regression.
* **Support Vector Machines (svm.py)**: Implements the support vector machine algorithm to find hyperplanes that best separate classes.
* **Clustering (kmeans.py)**: Implements the K-means clustering algorithm to identify groups within the data.
* **Preprocessing (preprocessing.py)**: Includes various techniques like normalization, scaling, and handling missing values.
* \[Any other algorithms you have, e.g., Neural Networks, XGBoost, etc.]
